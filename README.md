## Commits

To help ensure great commit messages for this project, consider using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary). Here's [an extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) to help you do that.

## Branching

`main` should only be for `Initial commit` and then not be used again until you are ready to deploy **something.** You should create a `dev` branch and use that for all development. Then, you can create feature branches off of `dev` and merge them back into `dev` when they are ready.

You could even do: `dev-server` and `dev-client` if you want to separate the two. From there, you might have: `dev-server-graphQL-type-defs` and `dev-server-graphQL-resolvers` and so on.

Delete branches after they are merged. You can always create a new branch if you need to. You should probably not have more than 3-4 branches at any 1Ô∏è‚É£ time. Use `git branch` to confirm.

### Protect ~~This üè†~~ Your `main` Branch

Here's [a guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) to do that.

It should be protected from force pushes and deletions. It should also require at least one review before merging.

## Code Quality

It might be good time to have [this](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) open and see how much of this you can apply.

## Getting Started

You probably want to work on `server` and `client` separately, and then you can start them together with `npm run dev` from the root for development.
