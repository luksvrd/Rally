## Description

Rally is a habit tracking app that uses modern web technologies such as Reactjs, mongoose, @apollo/server, graphql, and more to create a full-stack application that allows users to track their daily habits and compare their progress with others in habit tracking groups. The app is designed to promote healthy habits and help users stay accountable by providing a platform where they can view their stats, create new habits, and track their progress. In developing this app, the project team learned to use Reactjs to build dynamic user interfaces, mongoose to manage the database, and express to create a server and handle routing. The team also implemented the use of packages such as bcrypt and jsonwebtoken to help create a secure and functional app. With Rally, users can achieve their goals and develop healthy habits while enjoying the benefits of a supportive online community.
